# Vue AJAX

In this project I've creatd my own API and also used a public API to fetch characters and dynamically load and display information about those characters.  I have also used gsap animation to make it visually appealing and have used grids to make it responsive. This  website has an interactive way for users to learn more about the characters from the World of Ice and Fire.

## Objective
This website was created to understand the implementation of API and creation of API to populate a website at the same time making it responsive and interactive with animation and effects. This website also helps users learn about about the characters from the World of Ice and Fire.
